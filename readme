This repo is the projects that are listed on my resume/CV. There are 5 main ones: the finance report and analysis, data mining class and final project, hackathon (Hack Davis 2025: Number Ninja project), autoclean, and the options calculator in c++.
For all projects, it is best to look at the pdf's of the report for explanation or the readme. For any other questions please feel free to contact me!
