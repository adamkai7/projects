The following is the homework and my final project from a Data Mining and Analysis (Machine Learning) class I took at Stanford University's Summer session in June - August 2023.

Topics covered: classification, clustering, linear/multiple regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, boosting, neural networks, transformers, survival analysis, model evaluation, and regularization.

I did a final project where I programmed two machine learning models that predict and classify schizophrenia patients' future health outcomes based on various treatments. This was uploaded to 2 Kaggle competitions (solo) where I got 2nd and 7th place. To view information of the project please see the pdf called
