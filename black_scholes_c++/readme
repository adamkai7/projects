This is a file in C++ where the purpose of this code is to calculate the call and put option prices using the Black Scholes model in C++

This is the first major program I've done in C++, it is a language that Im very much am still a beginner at
However there are steps being made for me to become more advanced in this language 
An example of how to run the file is found in the code file
